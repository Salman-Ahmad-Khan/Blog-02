<p>Hello Devs, we are in the first week of 2022 now, and many of you might have already made your goals about what to learn in 2022, but if you haven't, then you have come to the right place. </p>

<p>Earlier, I have shared roadmaps to become a <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/10/the-java-developer-roadmap.html">Java developer</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/the-2018-devops-roadmap-31588d8670cb">DevOps Engineer</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/the-2019-react-js-developer-roadmap-9a8e290b8a56">React Developer</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/the-2019-web-developer-roadmap-ab89ac3c380e">Web Developer</a> and in this article, I share some of the best frameworks and libraries for web development, mobile app development, and big data, which an application developer can learn in 2022. </p>

<p>This New Year will be all about <a href="https://javinpaul.medium.com/10-frameworks-and-libraries-mobile-application-developers-can-learn-in-2020-e0b91391cade">Mobile App Development</a>, <a href="https://www.java67.com/2021/12/top-5-courses-to-learn-blockchain.html">Blockchain</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/07/top-5-online-courses-to-learn-cloud-computing-aws.html">Cloud Computing</a>. </p>

<p>Machine learning, and next-generation web with a greater focus on big data technologies like <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/04/top-5-hadoop-courses-to-learn-online.html">Hadoop</a> and <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2021/11/top-5-courses-to-learn-apache-spark-in.html">Spark</a>.</p>

<p>But you can still learn the popular Java and Web development frameworks like <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-2018-react-developer-roadmap.html">React</a>, <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/01/top-5-nodejs-and-express-js-online-courses-for-web-developers.html">Node.js</a>, <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/06/5-best-courses-to-learn-spring-boot-in.html">Spring Boot</a> to take your career to the next level. These frameworks are tried and tested and will be here for at least the next 5 years to come.</p>

<p>I have always believed in full-stack development, which means a Programmer should know both front-end and back-end technologies. Now it also includes mobile development technologies like <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2017/12/top-5-android-online-training-courses-for-Java-developers.html">Android</a> or <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/11/5-free-ios-app-development-courses-for.html">iOS</a>.</p>

<p>My simple advice for a Java programmer is to learn Android while for the <a href="https://medium.com/@javinpaul/top-10-courses-to-learn-c-for-beginners-best-and-free-4afc262a544e">C++ programmer</a> is to iOS so that you can create your own apps, do some freelancing and improve your chances of getting a job in the lucrative <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/01/10-things-mobile-app-developers-can-learn.html">mobile app development</a> sector.</p>

<p>In this highly competitive world where technologies get outdated very quickly, the only thing which helps a programmer is their learning ability. If you are a quick learner and can learn current technology in demand, you can find the job and the exciting work you are looking for.</p>

  10 Frameworks &amp; Libraries Developers Can Learn in 2022
</h2>

<p>Here is my list of some of the best web, mobile, and big data technologies for a programmer to learn in 2022. These technologies will make your resume more attractive help you take your career to the next level in the same job.</p>

<p>It's essential to keep moving forward because if you are stuck, you won't grow, and learning new and popular technologies always breaks the shackles.</p>

<h3>
  <a name="1-spring-boot" href="#1-spring-boot">
  </a>
  <strong>1. Spring Boot</strong>
</h3>

<p>Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications that you can "just run." Spring Boot takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. </p>

<p>If you are a Java developer working on web development, then I strongly suggest you learn Spring Boot in 2022.</p>

<p>Another good news to share with you guys is that NetBeans has added support for Spring Boot, so it's now easier to learn and develop Java web applications using Spring Boot 2. 0.</p>

<p>If you decide to learn Spring Boot in 2022, then <strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fmicroservices-with-spring-boot-and-spring-cloud%2F">Master Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud</a></strong> is a great course to start with. It's currently available at almost a 95% discount on Udemy until this week.</p>

<p><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fmicroservices-with-spring-boot-and-spring-cloud%2F"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j7srpT72--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zrUJwvgZ--/c_imagga_scale%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_900%2Cq_auto%2Cw_1600/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bupbqc9fctvw4j7r14it.png" alt="How to learn Spring Boot - best  resources" loading="lazy" width="880" height="495"></a></p>


<hr>

<h3>
  <a name="2-reactjs" href="#2-reactjs">
  </a>
  <strong>2. React.js</strong>
</h3>

<p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's declarative: React uses a declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason about your application.</p>

<p>It's efficient: React computes the minimal set of changes necessary to keep your DOM up-to-date. And it's flexible: React works with the libraries and frameworks.</p>

<p>In short, A declarative, dynamic, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. If you decide to learn to React in 2022, then <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Freact-redux%2F"><strong>Modern React with Hooks</strong></a> is an excellent online course to start with.</p>

<h3>
  <a name="3-nodejs" href="#3-nodejs">
  </a>
  <strong>3. Node.js</strong>
</h3>

<p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to write a server-side application in JavaScript. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.</p>

<p>If you learn Node.js and React, then you can write a client-server application in just one programming language, JavaScript.</p>

<p>If you decide to learn Node.js in 2022, I suggest checking out <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fthe-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2%2F"><strong>The complete Node.js Developer Course</strong></a>, one of the best courses to start with.</p>

<h3>
  <a name="4-angular" href="#4-angular">
  </a>
  <strong>4. Angular</strong>
</h3>

<p>Angular is an open-source JavaScript framework, maintained by Google, that assists with running single-page applications. Its goal is to augment web-based applications with model--view--controller (MVC) capability, to make both development and testing easier.</p>

<p>It's very different from its predecessor Angular JS, which is outdated now, but learning Angular 2 or Angular 8 is still a great idea in 2022.</p>

<p>If you decide to learn Angular in 2022, I suggest you first check the <a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fangular-fundamentals"><strong>Angular: Getting Started</strong></a> course from Pluralsight, one of the best courses.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/01/top-5-free-angular-js-online-courses-for-web-developers.html"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PeFnZ0iu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KVy6cfPuUCc/WlTLAnpCg2I/AAAAAAAAKCw/G4Yvh7jFknkuAc4ZLcd_IlVWRiUkVVYkwCLcBGAs/w400-h246/Angular%252BGetting%252BStarted%252BPluralsight%252Bcourse.jpg" alt="How to learn Angular" loading="lazy" width="399" height="246"></a></p>

<p>By the way, you would need Pluralsight membership access to this course, which costs around $29 per month or $299 annually (14% discount).</p>

<p>If you don't have Pluralsight membership, I encourage you to get one because it allows you to access their 5000+ online courses on all the latest topics like front-end and back-development, machine learning, etc.</p>

<p>It's more like Netflix for Software Developers, and Since learning is an integral part of our job, Pluralsight membership is a great way to stay ahead of your competition.</p>

<p>They also provide a <a href="http://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Flearn"><strong>10-day free trial</strong></a> without any commitment, which is an excellent way to access this course for free and to check the quality of courses before joining Pluralsight.</p>

<h3>
  <a name="9-flutter" href="#9-flutter">
  </a>
  <strong>9. Flutter</strong>
</h3>

<p>Flutter is another great tool/framework/library and a complete SDK for developing cross platform apps in 2022. You can use Flutter to build cross platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia, Web platform, and the web from a single codebase.</p>

<p>Similar to <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/06/5-best-courses-to-learn-angular.html">Angular</a>, and <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2021/10/coursera-tensorflow-advanced-techniques-specialization-review.html">TensorFlow</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/07/top-5-online-training-courses-to-learn-flutter.html">Flutter</a> also came from Google and its uses Dart Programming language, another JavaScript like object oriented programming language from Google. </p>

<p>The main advantage of using Flutter is that you can build both iOS and Android apps using same code base, which means you can release faster, fix bugs easily and it would be lot easier to manage then having separate codebase for different platforms.  </p>

<p>In other words, Flutter and React Native are alternative of each other, one uses Dart and other uses JavaScript as programming language. </p>

<p>If you want to learn Flutter for app development in 2022 I suggest you to join the <strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fflutter-bootcamp-with-dart%2F">The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart</a></strong> course by Angela Yu on Udemy. This course is great to learn both Flutter and Dart together. </p>

<p>Update: Earlier, I had included Xamarin, another platform from Microsoft's owned and quickly become famous for creating mobile apps for <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/01/top-5-free-data-structure-and-algorithm-courses-java--c-programmers.html">C</a>, <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-cpp-courses-to-learn-programming.html">C++</a>, and <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/11/top-5-courses-to-learn-c-sharp-in.html">C#</a> developers.</p>

<p>If you already know one of that C languages and looking for a career in mobile app development then you can learn Xamarin but Flutter and React Native are better choice. </p>

<p>And if you need a resource then <strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fcomplete-xamarin-developer-course-ios-and-android%2F">The Complete Xamarin Developer Course: iOS And Android!</a></strong> by Tim Buchalaka on Udemy is a good course to start with.</p>

  <strong>10. React Native</strong>
</h3>

<p>This is another mobile application development framework based upon JavaScript and the popular React framework. <strong>React Native</strong> is an extension of <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-react-courses-for-web-developers.html">React</a>, a popular JavaScript framework to develop web applications, which allows you to build native Android and iOs apps in JavaScript.</p>

<p>Unlike Ionic and Cordova, which promotes write once run everywhere but doesn't offer you to create a native app, React Native does convert your code into native code, especially for GUI.</p>

<p>This is a massive advantage for any JavaScript developer who wants to write the mobile application he has always dreamed about.</p>

<p>React Native along with Redux is becoming increasingly popular and turned out to be a valuable skill for your resume if you are looking for a job in the mobile app development space as well</p>

<p>If you decided to learn React Native in 2022, then **<a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fthe-complete-react-native-and-redux-course%2F">The Complete React Native and Redux Course</a> by Stephen Grider **is the best course to start with. </p>

<p>That's all about some of the best web development, mobile, machine learning, and big data frameworks and libraries software developers can learn learn in 2022. I especially like to focus on next-generation technologies like Big Data and Machine Learning and suggest you do so.</p>

<p>There is also a lot of demand for Data Scientists, and they are also getting excellent pay, on average $120,000, and that's the reason many friends and colleagues are switching to Data Science jobs. </p>

<p>I'll talk about more in the next article, where I'll share <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2021/01/10-tools-data-scientists-and-machine-learning-engineers.html">my tips to learn Data Science in 2022</a>.</p>
